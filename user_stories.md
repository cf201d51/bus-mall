# User Stories (As X, I want Y, so that Z)

## As the marketing research team

- ... we want to display three randomly and distinctly selected products side-by-side, so that focus group individuals can choose which they would be most likely to purchase.
- ... we want to display only items not already in the current set and also not in the previous set, so that the selection process is as untainted as possible.
- ... we want not to show results to users until after 25 selections, so that product selection process is as untainted as possible.
- ... we want to know the total number of clicks for each item, as well as the percentage of time an item was selected when shown so that we can test potential customer interest.
- ... we want to display a chart to the users showing the number of clicks for each item as well as the percentage of time an item was selected when shown so that the user is more engaged.

## As the developer

- ... I want to create a list of objects representing the BusMall items, so that information on each can be tracked.
- ... I want to maintain arrays of the current set and the previous set so that I can make sure that items are not duplicated.
- ... I want to display items of each set side-by-side consistently so that the user choice is unbiased by the presentation.
- ... I want to count for each item, the number of times it was shown, and the number of times it was selected so that I report to show which products are most popular can be generated.

## As a focus group participant

- ... I want an application that is easy to use so that I can complete the process with minimal distraction and confusion.
- ... I want the application to remember where it left off when the browser is restarted sa that I can see my data from before and I can resume from the previous session.
